### Day 1 7.6.21
#### Prompt: What are you excited to learn about in the program?
#### I am excited to get more familiar with the different machine learning models as well as learning about natural language processing or image processing. 

### Day 2 7.7.21
#### Prompt: What did you learn today?
#### Today, with the help of Dr. Kong, I got to learn about everyone's inspring origin stories. I also learned how to make my personal narrative be told in a meaningful way. The structure of Challenge, Choice, and Outcome helped me reflect on different periods of my life that I did not think had a lot of influence to the person I am today.
