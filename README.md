### Day 1 7.6.21
#### Prompt: What are you excited to learn about in the program?
#### I am excited to get more familiar with the different machine learning models as well as learning about natural language processing or image processing. 

### Day 2 7.7.21
#### Prompt: What did you learn today?
#### Today, with the help of Dr. Kong, I got to learn about everyone's inspring origin stories. I also learned how to make my personal narrative be told in a meaningful way. The structure of Challenge, Choice, and Outcome helped me reflect on different periods of my life that I did not think had a lot of influence to the person I am today. 


### Day 3 7.8.21
#### Promots: 1) What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
#### 2) Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

#### 1) Supervised learning requires that the input data be organized already while unsupervised learning will learn which are the input data points and thwir coorelation. Supervised learning gets trained by you while unsupervised learing it gets trained by past experiences. 
#### 2) Scikit-learn is created on top of all the other analysis libraries. It is false because scikit-learn requires graphviz to visualize the ML models in the scikit-learn library.
